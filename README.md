# awesome-hacktoberfest-plant-a-tree
This year the Hacktoberfest has the option "pick trees, not tees", but if you, like me, love the hacktoberfest t-shirt and collect all editions, but do not want to stop contributing to the environment and a sustainable future, in this awesome list you will find organisations where you can make a donation and plant a tree as well.
